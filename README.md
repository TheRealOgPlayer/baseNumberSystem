# baseNumberSystem
Use Any Base Number System You Want Be That Base 10 Or Base 16
This script was made by therealogplayer on Discord

# Restrictions
The base needs to be more then 1 but less then 86

Limit on the number you put in. Should be greater then 0 but less then 249999999999999999 (249,999,999,999,999,999)

Not a limit however base 62 (sexagenbidecimal(?)) would be the most accurate, anything after and the symbols are just randomly pressed on my keyboard so.... I may end up improving that but if you are reading this then base 62 is the most accurate. 


# About
This program allows you to have any base number system you want. This could be useful if you need to use a standered base like base 16(Hexadecimal) or base 2(Binary). It could also be used just for fun. I hope you enjoy and get a good use out of it.
