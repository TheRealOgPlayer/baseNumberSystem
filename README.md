# Version 0.2
Everthing Under This Point Is Only For Verison 0.2

# Changes
- Removed some bugs that would cause the program to crash. 
- Made the interface more user-friendly
- Added a second program that allows you to convert any base decimal.
- Program one is called the Decoder(This is the original program)
- Program Two is called the Encoder(This is the new program)
- Removed Restrictions, although not really. There are still restrictions but it will always attempt to solve the problem you gave it but if it ends up failing then it will give you an error.
- Added Debug Mode

# Debug Mode
- In both the encoder and the decoder on app startup you will be asked if you want to enable debug mode. 
- It is disabled by defult
- To enable it just type 'Y' inside the console on startup when prompted to.
- Enabling it will give you more information on why the program is not working.
- The debug info is given to you on the crash prompt.

# About
These programs allow you convert any number to and from decimal (Base 10) we use base 10 in our everyday life and this is a tool you can use to encode messages and decode messages. I hope you enjoy it is all. 

# Checksum
In order to check the Checksum open Powershell and CD into the file path and run the `Get-FileHash [FILE NAME]` command.

# baseNumberSystem
Use Any Base Number System You Want Be That Base 10 Or Base 16
This script was made by therealogplayer on Discord

# Restrictions
The base needs to be more then 1 but less then 86

Limit on the number you put in. Should be greater then 0 but less then 249999999999999999 (249,999,999,999,999,999)

Not a limit however base 62 (sexagenbidecimal(?)) would be the most accurate, anything after and the symbols are just randomly pressed on my keyboard so.... I may end up improving that but if you are reading this then base 62 is the most accurate. 


# About
This program allows you to have any base number system you want. This could be useful if you need to use a standered base like base 16(Hexadecimal) or base 2(Binary). It could also be used just for fun. I hope you enjoy and get a good use out of it.
